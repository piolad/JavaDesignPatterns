# Java Design Patterns
Design patterns are blueprints that are often used in software design to solve common problems.
Their use can facilitate communication between programmers, and their knowledge can expand problem solving abilites.

This repository contains my implementations of some of the most common Design Patterns.
- inspired by [Refactoring Guru - Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

## [Singleton](./src/main/java/Singleton/README.md)
Singleton class may only have 1 instance of its type.
This can be useful when we want to ensure that there is only one object of a type during runtime.

Examples may include an object accessing database - in case we want to structurally limit to one of those.
